                It was a bright Saturday morning. Splashes of warm sunlight shone through the big,
                    square window next to my bed, onto my quilt, causing a warm toasty scent to fill the room and
                    arouse a feeling of total bliss within me. The gentle babble of flowing water along with the
                    joyous chirping of birds softly stirred me awake. I rubbed my eyes and took a glance at the window:
                    the golden sunlight had already diffused throughout my room, glorious and dazzling. “It was now
                    time to get up for a fresh exciting day.”, my inner voice was telling me. I sat up, swung my
                    legs over the side of the bed, and dressed in the clothes that my grandma had laid out for me
                    the night before. I then jumped down to the floor and ran onto the balcony, where grandma was
                    bending over a large, rectangular concrete sink in the rear corner. She was hand washing our clothes.</p>
                <p>“Morning Grandma!”, I shouted, full of energy and excitement.</p>
                <p>Grandma turned her head, greeted, and kissed me on both of my cheeks, “Are you hungry, my dear? Let’s have breakfast.”</p>
                <p>She stopped what she was doing. We walked together towards the dining room.</p>
                <p>This was the scene nearly every day started during the first six years of my early childhood.</p>

                <p>Grandma was the soul of my childhood. When I was born, I started living with my grandparents and
                    stayed with them until I was six. The first six years of a child’s life is long enough to shape
                    their personality and build a foundation for that child’s later development. Six years is also
                    short and a fleeting of time within one’s life span. I was the bud, she was the gardener.
                    She continuously fed me with endless love. While I was growing up with Grandma, she was in her
                    early 50’s and retired. She was a wonderful combination of warmth and kindness, laughter, and love,
                    and still is to this day. Her memory will live inside me for all the days of my life.</p>
